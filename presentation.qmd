> "Although cost modelling and demand modelling can be framed as statistical machine learning tasks, deriving the final pricing outputs involves additional steps, such as price optimisation and strategic pricing decisions (i.e., marketing and competition considerations). These aspects extend beyond the scope of a pure machine learning algorithm." [Source: Actuaries Digital, 2025](https://www.actuaries.asn.au/)

## AI Techniques in Actuarial Science

-   Machine Learning (ML): Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement learning
-   Deep Learning (DL): Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
-   Natural Language Processing (NLP): Sentiment Analysis, Chatbots
-   Predictive Analytics: Time Series Forecasting, Anomaly Detection
-   Simulation Models: Monte Carlo Simulation
-   Robotic Process Automation (RPA): Claims processing automation

# R for AI-Driven Actuarial Analysis

## Why Use R?

-   Beginner-friendly
-   Open-source community support
-   Strong ecosystem for statistical computing
-   Integration with AI & ML frameworks
-   Visualization & interpretability tools



# Case Study: Predicting Health Insurance Fraud

## Data Overview

-   Synthetic dataset of insurance claims
-   Features: age, gender, policy type, claim amount
-   Objective: Predict likelihood of a claim


## Hands-On: Risk Prediction in R with AI


# Conclusion


## Key Takeaways

1.  AI is transforming actuarial science: It is increasingly common for people to use generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT for coding help:

    -   These tools can provide useful guidance by analyzing your error message.
    -   However, the responses are generated based on statistical models and may include errors.
    -   Always verify and understand the code suggested by AI tools before using it.

2.  R provides powerful tools for predictive modeling

3.  Practical applications span across insurance & risk management

## Next Steps

-   Explore more AI models in R
-   Apply ML to real actuarial datasets
